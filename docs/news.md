# News

As of this writing, a new MIT Libraries News theme is under development. [The repo for this theme is here.](https://github.com/mitlibraries-ux/mit-libraries-news)

While this theme exists as a child theme of the main libraries.mit.edu WordPress theme, many of the relevant styles and scripts for /news (as well as relevant Grunt tasks) are actually being built inside the parent theme. [The news branch contains this development work.](https://github.com/mitlibraries-ux/MITlibraries-parent/tree/news) This is primarily to ensure that a comprensive, congruous design/theming system is maintained across the libraries.mit.edu WordPress instance.
