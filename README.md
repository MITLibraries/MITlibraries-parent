[MIT Libraries](http://libraries.mit.edu) Wordpress Theme
========

This is the main Wordpress theme for the MIT Libraries.

__Note:__ Primary CSS and JS (including `css/build/minified/global.css`, `js/build/hours.min.js` and `js/build/production.min.js`, as registered in `functions.php`) are not checked in. These build files are complied and/or concatenated and/or minified automatically (using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), for example).
